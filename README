A personal portfolio website built with React, React Router, Material UI, and a simple localStorage-based authentication flow (signup/login/logout). It supports light/dark themes and includes sections for Introduction, Skills, Projects, and Contact.

> Design note: This project is structured to let you closely match the provided Figma mockup. Swap images, tweak spacing/typography, and update colors to match the design exactly.

## Features
- Signup & Login (localStorage-backed; no backend required)
- Protected portfolio route (requires login)
- Session persistence
- Portfolio sections: Intro, Skills, Projects, Contact (with validation)
- Light/Dark theme toggle (Material UI)
- React Router navigation
- Clean, accessible, responsive layout

## Getting Started

```bash
# 1) Install dependencies
npm install

# 2) Run locally
npm run dev

# 3) Build for production
npm run build
npm run preview

Customization Checklist

In Sections.jsx, replace profile avatar, name, profession, and buttons with your details.

Update projects array (title, description, repo, demo, image).

Replace /resume.pdf link with your resume (place a file named resume.pdf in the project root or public folder).

Adjust MUI theme colors in ThemeContext.jsx to match the Figma file.

If you prefer Bootstrap instead of MUI, you can replace components accordingly.

Deployment
Deploy to Vercel

Push this project to a GitHub repository.

Go to Vercel dashboard → New Project → Import your repo.

Framework preset: Vite (auto-detected). Build command: vite build or npm run build; Output: dist.

Add Build Command: npm run build, Output Directory: dist.

Deploy.

Since auth uses localStorage only, this is a demo auth flow. For production-ready auth, consider Firebase Auth, Auth0, or your own backend.

Notes on the Figma

Use MUI spacing and sx props to fine-tune paddings/margins to pixel-match the mock.

Create additional components (Hero, About, Timeline, etc.) if your mockup includes them.

Add motion (e.g., Framer Motion) if required by the assignment for extra polish.
